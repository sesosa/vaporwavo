live demo: http://sesosa.com/vaporwavo/login.php

instructions: 

there are three pages for this site, the login/signup page, the home page, and the upload page. 
you begin on the login page where you can either log in to an existing account or create a new account. 

once you are logged in, you will be taken to the homepage. this page lists all of the music that is 
currently available to listen to. You can click on the play button and listen to the music while you 
enjoy the stunning visuals. 

with the upload page, you must include an embedded link for a song to display.
you can use the following examples for the links if you want:

<iframe width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/235263749&amp;color=ff5500&amp;inverse=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_user=true"></iframe>

<iframe width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/129471632&amp;color=ff5500&amp;inverse=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_user=true"></iframe>

links must be in this format.


testing: 

i tested my program with multiple types of input.
however the login does not validate for an actual user.
